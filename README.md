# Andrea Licheri's school monorepo
Here you can find all the homework I managed to target by using code.
- Stuff here is not open-source, but just a show-off. If you want to re-use code, please open an issue.
- All projects are organized by date
- This monorepo doesn't use fancy tools like TurboRepo or NX.js, since most project are static

KTHXBYE
